These are tools for programming the Video Grpahics Array (VGA) using additions
from the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) including their tools
for the Video BIOS Extension (VBE) version 3. There is also an extensive list
of functions for programming the mouse at the level of hardware interrupts.

A lot of this stuff is quite old. I wrote much of it when I was learning how to
do graphics programming in DOS. As it is, the code will only compile for the
DJGPP toolchain, which is a port of GCC to DOS.
